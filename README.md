# JavaScript Quiz


This application was designed to showcase the use of JavaScript with HTML and CSS but for the most part how JavaScript can be used to manipulate HTML.


The quiz begins at a start page with brief instructions to advise how the application will proceed.

Once you hit start, you are presented with the first set of questions and the timer starts to countdown.

An incorrect response will deduct 10 seconds from the timer and push you to the next question.
A correct response will increase the score by 1 and push you to the next question.

Once all questions have been answered you are pushed to a final page with your score and the time left on the clock.

You are presented with an option to retake the quiz should you be inclined to do so.
